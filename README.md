# SFC Web Scraping using Selenium

Here is one of the Python programming projects I have done in my previous internship.

As the required website "https://apps.sfc.hk/publicregWeb/searchByRa?locale=en" is dynamically loaded with javascript, it provides results based on users' actions.
Hence, the Python Selenium module is usede to "mimic" the human actions and, as a result, successfully extract all the required information on the site.

In this program, I will attempt to extract all companies' info (CE Ref Num, Name, Chinese Name, Address, With active Record) 
under the "Type 9: Asset Management, Corporation" criteria.
